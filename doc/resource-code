	 On modifying code dynamically loaded from resources
	 ===================================================

			  Brief introduction

This source tree does not contain the complete set of code that makes
up the full game. Rather, some of it is loaded at runtime via
resources, using Java's dynamic class-loading framework. Common
examples include specific UI widgets, sprites requiring custom code,
and so on. This has numerous benefits to game development, the most
important of which is the ability to include new client code in
updates without requiring every player to update their clients.

Unfortunately, it also means that some of the code that is interesting
for client modification is not available in this source tree. The
problem is exacerbated by the fact that, the more specific some piece
of code is to a specific game mechanic, not only is it more likely to
be located in a resource, it is also more likely to be interesting for
client modification.

In an attempt to alleviate this problem, resources that contain
dynamic code have also been made to incorporate the corresponding Java
source code, so that it is available for client modification. This
documentation covers the tools available to fetch, extract, manage and
update such source code.


			Fetching resource code

The `haven.Resource' class has a static main() function that can be
called from the command-line to fetch and maintain resource code. It
currently has two sub-commands: `get-code' and `find-updates'. In
order to fetch the source code from a particular resource, the
`get-code' command is used. For example, to fetch the code from the
`ui/tt/name' resource, invoke Java as such:

 > java -cp bin/hafen.jar haven.Resource get-code ui/tt/name

By default, this puts any source files found in the resource in the
`src' subdirectory of the current working directory. In other words,
it is mainly meant to be run from the root of the client source
tree. In case it is desired to run the command from another directory,
or to use a staging directory, or for any other reason put the files
into some other directory, the desired target directory can be
specified with the `-o' command-line argument. For example:

 > java -cp bin/hafen.jar haven.Resource get-code -o staging ui/tt/name

If need be, the `get-code' command can also fetch multiple resources
in one invocation. For example:

 > java -cp bin/hafen.jar haven.Resource get-code ui/tt/name ui/tt/food

All sub-commands use standard Posix command-line syntax and support
the `-h' option to print a brief usage message for shorthand use. For
example:

 > java -cp bin/hafen.jar haven.Resource get-code -h

It should be noted that source files are extracted into subdirectories
corresponding to their Java packages. For example, if extracting the
`ui/tt/name' resource as above, it will extract the file
`src/haven/res/ui/tt/name/Name.java'. The files extracted will be
listed in the command output for reference.

NOTE: The `get-code' command always overwrites any files that it would
extract without asking, so it is recommended to check if there are any
uncommitted changes to potentially affected files before running it.


		      Source referral annotation

As part of fetching resource source code, `get-code' also annotates
the top-level class in each fetched file with a `haven.FromResource'
annotation, which contains information about the name and version of
the resource it was fetched from. This annotation serves two purposes,
documented below under "updating resource code" and "version override".


		   Using and compiling fetched code

Since `get-code' extracts files into the `src' directory, anything
thus fetched will be compiled and included in the compiled client by
default. Since the code compiled along with the client is loaded by a
classloader that is a parent of resource-loaded classes, Java's
default classloading behavior implies that code thus included is also
used in preference to that fetched at runtime. This is *mostly* true
in this case, but the resource classloader implements an exception to
this behavior, as documented below, under "version override".

Since any fetched code is in the same compilation tree as the rest of
the client code, the compiler considers them part of the same
classpath, and as such they can refer freely back and forth between
each other. No use of reflection should be necessary.


			Updating resource code

The `find-updates` sub-command can be used to check for updates to any
fetched resource code. It iterates through all source code files,
looking for the `haven.FromResource' annotation (described above), and
checks the origin server for newer versions of the referred
resources. If there are any updated versions, they are listed on
standard output. It would usually be invoked as such:

 > java -cp bin/hafen.jar haven.Resource find-updates

Note that `find-updates' only lists found updates; it does not
actually fetch any updated code, so that it is always "safe" to
run. Use `get-code' to fetch updated resources, but note, as described
above, that `get-code' overwrites files without asking.

Like `get-code', `find-updates' looks for source files in the `src'
subdirectory of the current working directory by default. Like
`get-code', it can take an explicit directory to search through, by
way of an optional command-line argument. For example:

 > java -cp bin/hafen.jar haven.Resource find-updates src/haven/res

Like `get-code', it also uses standard Posix command-line syntax and
supports the `-h' option to print a brief usage message.


			   Version override

Other than for finding updates, the secondary purpose of the
`haven.FromResource' annotation is to allow the resource classloader
to override local (fetched) code selectively. The default behavior is
to allow a local class to override the same class available from a
resource only if it has the `FromResource' annotation, and the
resource name and version in the annotation matches the name and
version of the resource whose code would be overridden.

The reason this behavior differs from Java's default classloading
behavior is to allow modified clients to degrade gracefully in
functionality in case of resource updates, until such time as the
client can be updated to reflect the newer resources. Updates to a
resource may include changes that break compatibility (either from
incompatible Java linkage, or from decoding of updated protocol
formats, or otherwise), in which case a client which still uses local,
out-of-date copies of said code is likely to outright crash. While
using code from more up-to-date resources is likely to degrade the
client in functionality, it should normally be able to keep running
with whatever other functionality it has until it can be updated to
reflect changes in the updated resource code, avoiding outright
crashes.

In cases where it may be useful, there are ways to override this
behavior. Primarily, it can toggled on a file-by-file basis by setting
`override = true' in the `FromResource' annotation in a particular
class. Doing so will make sure the local code with said annotation
always overrides the same code from a fetched resource. There also
exists the `OVERRIDE_ALL' constant in Resource.java, which causes all
local code to always override code from resources. None of these
measures are particularly recommended, since, as described,
out-of-date local code is likely to crash in case of unexpected
resource updates, but the mechanism is available in case it is
desired.


			    Tips & Tricks

In case you want to use Git to manage merges and conflicts of upstream
resource code, one tip is to create a secondary branch containing only
the unmodified resource code. Using the branch name
`upstream-resources' here (for illustrative purposes only), this would
be done by creating the branch from the upstream history,
`origin/master', fetch the resource code there, commit said code, and
then merging the `upstream-resource' branch into your main development
branch. Assuming that your main development branch is named `master',
the procedure might look like this:

 > git checkout -b upstream-resources origin/master
 > java -cp bin/hafen.jar haven.Resource get-code ui/tt/name
 > git add src/haven/res
 > git commit -m "Fetched ui/tt/name"
 > git checkout master
 > git merge upstream-resources

Naturally, on subsequent fetches and/or updates, you would merely
check out `upstream-resources' instead of creating it, but otherwise
the procedure should be the same, and Git, then having been given a
merge-base to work from, should be able to handle merges and conflicts
as it normally does. It may be a good idea to keep the
`upstream-resources' branch up-to-date with the rest of the
development history, but generally speaking, it should not make a
difference.
